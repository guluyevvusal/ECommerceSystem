E-Commerce Order Processing System
The E-Commerce Order Processing System is a robust, scalable solution designed for handling and managing online orders in a seamless and efficient manner. Built using modern technologies and a microservices architecture, it ensures high performance, reliability, and security. Here are the key components and technologies used:

Core Technologies:
.NET 9 Web API (Microservices)
The system is built with .NET 9, leveraging a microservices architecture for flexible and independent scaling of individual components. This architecture ensures high availability and fault tolerance in processing e-commerce transactions.

Entity Framework Core (Database ORM)
Entity Framework Core is used for data access and ORM, simplifying database operations and providing an easy way to manage the application's data layer.

RabbitMQ (Event-driven Messaging)
RabbitMQ serves as the event-driven messaging system, facilitating asynchronous communication between different microservices. This ensures decoupling, smooth data flow, and improved scalability.

Redis (Cache)
Redis is integrated as a caching mechanism to enhance the system's performance by reducing database load and providing faster access to frequently requested data, such as product details and user information.

Docker (Containerization)
The entire application is containerized using Docker, allowing for easy deployment, scalability, and consistency across various environments. This makes it possible to manage and update individual services without affecting the whole system.

Serilog + ELK Stack (Logging)
Comprehensive logging is implemented using Serilog, with centralized log storage and analysis powered by the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana). This setup provides deep insights into system performance, debugging, and monitoring.

Azure / AWS S3 (Cloud Storage)
For storing and managing large files, such as product images and invoices, Azure or AWS S3 is utilized. These cloud platforms offer secure, scalable, and highly available storage solutions.

JWT Authentication (Security)
The system ensures secure user authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Token), protecting sensitive data and ensuring that only authorized users can access specific resources and services.

Key Features:
Order Management:
Efficient processing of customer orders, from order placement to fulfillment, with real-time updates on order status.

Inventory Tracking:
Accurate tracking and management of product stock levels, ensuring the system reflects the latest inventory status.

Scalability & High Availability:
Designed for scalability, the system can handle high traffic volumes and provide uninterrupted service, even under heavy load.

Real-time Processing:
With RabbitMQ, orders and events are processed in real-time, ensuring that the system remains responsive and efficient.

Seamless Integration:
The system easily integrates with various third-party services, such as payment gateways, shipping providers, and external inventory systems.

This E-Commerce Order Processing System is ideal for businesses that require a flexible, secure, and highly performant solution to manage online orders and scale as they grow.
